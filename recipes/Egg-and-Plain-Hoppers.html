    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cup(s) Raw Rice soaked for 4-5 hours.</li>
      <li>A handful of cooked rice.</li>
      <li>4 cups shavings.</li>
      <li>A pinch of yeast granules dissolved in some or a little hot water</li>
      <li>and sugar to taste.</li>
      <li>Eggs, Honey, Coconut Milk (Optional).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Drain the soaked rice and grind it along with the coconut shavings and
        cooked rice to a fine thick paste. Do not add too much water.
      </li>
      <li>
        Coconut Water may be preferably used instead of water for grinding. Add
        the yeast and mix lightly. Mix in the salt and sugar to taste.
      </li>
      <li>Allow to ferment at room temperature for at least 6 hours.</li>
      <li>
        Heat a small appa chatti. Pour approximately half a cup of batter and
        quickly but gently swirl the pan around so that only a thin layer of the
        batter covers the sides and a thick layer collects at the bottom.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can then add any of the optional ingredients such as an egg or some
        Coconut Milk. If you prefer the plain hopper, just leave it to cook.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover with a lid and cook each hopper on medium heat for about 3 minutes
        or till the edges have become golden crisp and the centre is soft and
        spongy.
      </li>
    </ul>
